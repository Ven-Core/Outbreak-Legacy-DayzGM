# Outbreak Legacy DayZ - (GAMEMODE SA:MP GTA SA)

It is available at any moment. I chose to leak it and make it open source so that anyone could use it because I'm leaving GTA SA:MP, and this gamemode will be discontinued. Although it is open source, the gamemode itself was broken, but I have patched it, and this is the updated and fixed version. 🚀
