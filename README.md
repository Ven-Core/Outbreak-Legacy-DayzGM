# Zombie DayZ Modified By VenThings

It is available at any moment. I chose to leak it or make it open source so that anyone could use it because I'm leaving SA:MP and this gamemode will be discontinued. Although it is open source, the gamemode itself is broken, so I patched it, and this is the updated and fixed version.
